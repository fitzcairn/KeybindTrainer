What is KeybindTrainer?

KeybindTrainer is an addon to help you learn your keybinds by testing how well you know them. It does this by showing Trials, or sequences of icons for the bound actions on your bars. The addon supports a wide variety of configuration options. In addition, KeybindTrainer also allows you to create, import, and share Custom Trials to test how quickly you can hit important key combinations, such as the infamous "Cloak and Vanish" for Rogues.

KeybindTrainer is usable anywhere and anytime, in or out of combat. Type /kbt to see options.

Disable all other addons and see if the problem still happens.

Then, submit a bug report in the ticket tracker. Be sure to include as much of the information requested in the ticket template as you can.

Finally, remember to check on your ticket after a few days. If a ticket is waiting on a response from you for more than a week, I'll assume you've solved the issue on your own.
