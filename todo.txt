Next Steps:

 - UPDATE ALL UNIT TESTS, particular to use my new shared libraries.


 - TEST with Dominos, BindPad, etc

 - TEST Custom Trials!

 - Move test/TestEnv to my new util library!  That should be shared
across all my addons.



 - Have Mary test, push update.


   ALSO: ADD BINDS SPECIFICALLY FOR SHAMAN TOTEM SETS!






















BUGS FIXED:
 X Not sure how, but actions without keybinds are recieving
keybinds. (answer: keybinds kept for actionbars that aren't visible)
 X Help scrollbars do weird shit when clicked. (fixed)
 X !! Figure out how to order menu items alpha !! (fixed by making order in menu reflect order added)
   X There are bugs around the menu, solve this.
 X Stats bug Mary found.
 X When deleting the last custom trial, the edit trial button stays
lit (and does nothing).  disable this.
 X When running continuously, do NOT reset misses until very end.
   Show aggregate misses to user!
 X HUGE BUG: when deleting and re-creating trials, sometimes actions
get null'd out, not sure why?!?!!?
   o Repro: Create custom trial, delete it, re-create it, run it, error.
 X Issue with companion summoning--see Run.lua around 117 (this is now
handled, Run.lua:212)
 X Randomize bind order doesn't work for default trials.
 X When there is nothing on the first bar, the simulation crashes
 X Random delay not very random. (yeah it is, looks good)
 X Mousebuttons working correctly??? (yes!!)
 X TEST COMBAT TAINT (appears to be no problem)
 X Keybind bug--when changing keybinds and restarting the trial,
   both the old and new keybinds are maintained for the action.
   X Solve via unit tests!!!!!!
 X Weirdness in how binds are mapped to action slots.  Check it out
   on donuts--for some reason binds are assigned to slots where they
   don't exist.
   X Fixed--was picking up action buttons from a previous spec.
 X Allow redefined keybinds to get picked up for every trial start.
   o This appears to be happening correctly
 X Fix what happens when icon size is too large to display entire 
   multi-action tuple on screen--clip icons.
   o Clipping is bad, will display, but normalized behavior between
     random and non.
 X Weird issue with keybind map building.  Try moving
   binds around and seeing what gets saved in the map.
 X BUGS DUE TO 4.0.1 
   o Issues fixed:
     X Cooldown sizes are fucked!  Something new as of 4.0.1 (hack fix)
     X Bug in how first alt- bind affects trial?? (fixed--was an error in iterator)
     X Running custom trials generates error.
     X Major binds problem??!?!?! (problem was my java-style iterators were fucked.)
     X Icons don't respect top of area when doing random positions--can overlap. (Blizz redid their coords, fuck)
     X For some reason, the first bind on the bar is skipped.  ???
     X No icons on stats graph
     X Clicking "Save" with empty custom trial input box gives error.
     X Highlighting on the dropdown menu is off. (not a huge deal, resolving)
     X Stats has issues--displaying stats is broken.

when spell name not found on your bars?  When spell names collide?
 X USE UTF8 STRING SUB FROM HERE:
   http://wowprogramming.com/snippets/UTF-8_aware_stringsub_7
   (This doesn't appear to be an issue--tested with utf chars)
 X Fix Custom Trial boxes--widths on shit are wrong

 X !! ANOTHER BUG !!

Need to do a FULL SCAN of keybinds to allow for custom trials to work.

Visible scans are only useful for the default trials!  GAY!

 X !!! HUGE BUG !!!

PROBLEM:
Different spells/macros/etc on the action bar can share the same
name. :( This fucks up all sorts of things.

SOLUTION:
In short, we need to rearrange how bind information is stored.

Before:
slot_to_binds, name_to_binds, name_to_type, texture_cache = ...

After:
action_info = {
               id = {
                     names = {},
                     binds = {},
                     type  = spell|macro|etc...
                     texture = "/path/to" text
                    }              
              }
Note that action_info is never cleared, just updated.

slot_to_binds = {
                slot = id block from above
                }

name_to_ids = {
              name = { ..id blocks from above.. }
              }

After this change, need to:
  - Update Action objects to refer to ids, not names in all functions.
    Then update tests.
  - Update parser to do the right thing when parsing names/spell ids
    o If conflict with names, throw an error and ask for ids.  Add tests.
    o Update parser to be able to take in other action type ids (macros,
      equimpent sets, etc).  Add tests.




-- OLD Spec for how trials are specified --

trial
   [ "name", ("desc",)? [ trial_set ] (, delay)? ]
trial_set
   [ multi_action_tuple ] (, trial_set)?
   action_tuple (, trial_set)?
